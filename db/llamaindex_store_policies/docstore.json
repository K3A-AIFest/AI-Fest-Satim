Encryption is an effective tool in mitigating the threat of unauthorized access to data.\n\n3.0 Scope\n\nThis standard applies to all systems, which includes websites and web services, for which the entity has administrative responsibility, including those managed and hosted by third-parties on behalf of the entity.\n\n4.0 Information Statement\n\nThe need for encryption of information is based on its classification, risk assessment results, and use case. \n\nAttention must be given to the regulations and national restrictions (e.g., export controls) that may apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in different parts of the world.  The U.S. Government restricts the export, disclosure, or release of encryption technologies to foreign countries or foreign nationals, including \u201cdeemed exports\u201d to foreign nationals within the United States (excluding those foreign nationals with permanent resident visas (i.e., Green Cards), U.S. citizenship, or \u2018protected person\u2019 status).  If you have any questions, please contact Counsel and Legal Services.\n\nEncryption products for confidentiality of data at rest and data in transit must incorporate Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) approved algorithms for data encryption. Approved encryption algorithms are contained in Appendix A.\n\nHashing algorithms transform a digital message into a short representation for use in digital signatures and other applications to validate the integrity of the message\n\nAlthough hash functions such as SHA 1, provide a certain amount of security strength, it does not meet all security requirements for keyed-hash functions such as HMAC SHA 1. Refer to FIPS 180-4 for more information on different types of application hashing algorithms as well as Appendix A.\n\nHashing algorithms can be used for multiple purposes including but not limited to, digital signatures, message authentication codes, key derivation functions, pseudo random functions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2335, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5676538-0d24-43fc-91f7-f4938710d378": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5676538-0d24-43fc-91f7-f4938710d378", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Encryption-Standard.docx", "file_path": "/home/raid/projects/AIFest25/satim/AI-Fest-Satim/policies/Encryption-Standard.docx", "file_type": "docx", "file_size": 40854, "creation_date": "2025-06-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-13", "document_index": 3, "filename": "Encryption-Standard.docx"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/home/raid/projects/AIFest25/satim/AI-Fest-Satim/policies/Encryption-Standard.docx_part_0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Encryption-Standard.docx", "file_path": "/home/raid/projects/AIFest25/satim/AI-Fest-Satim/policies/Encryption-Standard.docx", "file_type": "docx", "file_size": 40854, "creation_date": "2025-06-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-13", "document_index": 3, "filename": "Encryption-Standard.docx"}, "hash": "4bfceff08f9911b13ebc1c78234813daac9c852d642e73b564bee492813a0d36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3c02124-e5e5-4a71-8566-a0b01ebea11d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Encryption-Standard.docx", "file_path": "/home/raid/projects/AIFest25/satim/AI-Fest-Satim/policies/Encryption-Standard.docx", "file_type": "docx", "file_size": 40854, "creation_date": "2025-06-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-13", "document_index": 3, "filename": "Encryption-Standard.docx"}, "hash": "b956103dd77aec89fbb9f57f29adcddeaa0f410cf07a2aa578607264e65e5687", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "08fce423-7b02-4c50-bf8d-6478f93f8c02", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d0bf99e8ef32eaffaf12218afbbb1e565322f77df6b7e81ca8c9cdc1d43b4ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Refer to FIPS 180-4 for more information on different types of application hashing algorithms as well as Appendix A.\n\nHashing algorithms can be used for multiple purposes including but not limited to, digital signatures, message authentication codes, key derivation functions, pseudo random functions. \n\nApproved hashing functions are contained in Appendix A.  \n\nUse of outdated, cryptographically broken, proprietary encryption algorithms/hashing functions is prohibited.\n\nDue to the prevalence of incorrectly implemented cryptography, encryption products must have FIPS 140 (Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules) validation and be operated in FIPS mode.

Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems\n\nInformation Classification Process\n\nThe information classification process must include the following:\n\nIdentification of information assets;\n\nClassification of information assets; by confidentiality, integrity, and availability (\u201cCIA\u201d); and\n\nDetermining controls based upon the classification.\n\nIdentification of Information Assets\n\nIdentification of information assets involves creating an inventory of all information assets in the entity.  The following items need to be considered when constructing this inventory:\n\n\tGrouping of information assets\n\n\tDetermining the information owner\n\n\tDetermining the information custodian\n\n\tIdentifying information assets\n\n\tGrouping of Information Assets\n\nTo facilitate the classification of information assets and allow for a more efficient application of controls, it may be desirable to appropriately group information assets together.  A broad grouping may result in applying controls unnecessarily as the asset must be classified at the highest level necessitated by its individual data elements.  For example, if a Human Resources unit decides to classify all of their personnel files as a single information asset and any one of those files contains a name and social security number, the entire grouping would need to be protected with moderate confidentiality controls.\n\nA narrow grouping allows for more precise targeting of controls.  However, as there are more information assets to classify, this increases the complexity of the classification and the management of controls.  Using the previous example, classifying the multitude of personnel files (e.g., appointment letters, timecards, position classifications, holiday waivers) as individual information assets requires a different set of controls for each classification.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5685, "end_char_idx": 8118, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4e08dce-474f-4acc-ba1a-bcdc540bd3ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4e08dce-474f-4acc-ba1a-bcdc540bd3ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Information-Classification-Standard.docx", "file_path": "/home/raid/projects/AIFest25/satim/AI-Fest-Satim/policies/Information-Classification-Standard.docx", "file_type": "docx", "file_size": 78766, "creation_date": "2025-06-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-13", "document_index": 6, "filename": "Information-Classification-Standard.docx"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/home/raid/projects/AIFest25/satim/AI-Fest-Satim/policies/Information-Classification-Standard.docx_part_0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Information-Classification-Standard.docx", "file_path": "/home/raid/projects/AIFest25/satim/AI-Fest-Satim/policies/Information-Classification-Standard.docx", "file_type": "docx", "file_size": 78766, "creation_date": "2025-06-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-13", "document_index": 6, "filename": "Information-Classification-Standard.docx"}, "hash": "5a3265ec60560a9bfdc92ce84e01bc4f0e5fe9bd7e60e50cdb173f2d25b59f8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "20081cf7-5e8f-4758-b8b1-f49b6ed1d11f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Information-Classification-Standard.docx", "file_path": "/home/raid/projects/AIFest25/satim/AI-Fest-Satim/policies/Information-Classification-Standard.docx", "file_type": "docx", "file_size": 78766, "creation_date": "2025-06-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-13", "document_index": 6, "filename": "Information-Classification-Standard.docx"}, "hash": "12347a945fee7b1a6e68e1e5a34bee739b1b53994130f4be1bbdaa0a375d8214", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0b51bd51-2dbf-4ae9-8b17-84b939a08d73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0b485725a8cc96ef9ae39b2f7429afbf638dcf362a7d1fefc91a9718208040d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A narrow grouping allows for more precise targeting of controls.

The purpose of this supplement is to provide additional guidance on the information classification process.\n\n\n\nIdentifying Information Assets\n\n\tAn efficient approach towards identifying information assets is for information owners to maintain an inventory for each information asset in their control. The inventory should minimally include the following:\n\n\t\n\nSource of the information asset (e.g., unit, agency)\n\nUse of the information asset (i.e., purpose/business function)\n\nBusiness processes dependent on the information asset\n\nUsers/groups of users of the information asset \n\nOwner of the information asset\n\n\t\n\n\tInformation assets can be identified using the template provided in Section One of Appendix A or this information can be extracted from an existing information inventory, if available.  Job titles, in place of named individuals, can be used for the custodian, owner, and users in order to ease maintenance of your information asset inventory.

practice designed to proactively prevent the exploitation of IT vulnerabilities that exist within an organization. By applying security related software or firmware updates (patches) to applicable IT systems, the expected result is reduced time and money spent dealing with exploits by reducing or eliminating the related vulnerability. \n\n2.0 Authority\n\n \n\n3.0 Scope\n\nThis standard relates specifically to vulnerabilities that can be addressed by a software or firmware update (patch) and applies to all software used on the entity\u2019s systems.  The Vulnerability Scanning Standard should be followed for requirements on addressing non-patched vulnerabilities.\n\n4.0 Information Statement\n\n\tEntities must assign an individual or group within IT operations to be responsible for patch management.\n\n\tIf patch management is outsourced, service level agreements must be in place that address the requirements of this standard and outline responsibilities for patching.
