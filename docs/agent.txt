 WE HAve 2 index vector dbs polices and standarts , polices should be evaluated against standards , in 3 asepcts 
 1. indentifying the gaps and missing things in the policies comprared to the standards . 
 2. checking the compliance of the policies compared to the standards .
 3. enhacing the current current policy based on 2 and 3 


1. i want this to be a mixture of experts that are all can access the web and should evaluate the polciy from diffrent aspects ,  in a disucssion based with loop  between the expertds 
2. indentifying the gaps should be a loop based.
3. create the modues gap_checker , compliance_checker , and enhancor 

they all take 2 args , one string  of polict and a list of string of standartds to be evaluated against based on 1, 2, and 3  

Now use the following code base as a start u have a base agent with web search tool , add more tools that usees the 2 index vector databses (polices and standartds with wuery rewrites and stuff like that to fetch relvant docs )



How to serve the solution , 3 endpoints that serves feeatures 1 , 2 , 3 and taks args as specfied in the args of each pipline , but remeer to make the output systematic and with high recall and accruacy

1 Introduction and PCI Data Security Standard Overview  
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) was developed to encourage and enhance payment account data security and 
facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures globally. PCI DSS provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designed to protect account data. While specifically designed to focus on environments with payment account data, PCI DSS 
can also be used to protect against threats and secure other elements in the payment ecosystem.  Table 1 shows the 12 principal PCI DSS requirements. 
Table 1. Principal PCI DSS Requirements PCI Data Security Standard – High Level Overview Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems 1. Install and Maintain Network Security Controls. 
2. Apply Secure Configurations to All System Components. 
Protect Account Data 3. Protect Stored Account Data. 
4. Protect Cardholder Data with Strong Cryptography During Transmission Over Open, 
Public Networks. 
Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program 5. Protect All Systems and Networks from Malicious Software. 
6. Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Software. 
Implement Strong Access Control Measures 7. Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know. 
8. Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System Components. 
9. Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data. 
Regularly Monitor and Test Networks 10.  Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data. 
11.  Test Security of Systems and Networks Regularly. 
Maintain an Information Security Policy 12.  Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs. This document, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Requirements and Testing Procedures, consists of the 12 PCI DSS 
principal requirements, detailed security requirements, corresponding testing procedures, and other information pertinent to each requirement. 
The following sections provide detailed guidelines and best practices to assist entities to prepare for, conduct, and report the results of a PCI 
DSS assessment. The PCI DSS requirements and testing procedures begin on page 43.

Policy #:Title:Effective Date:x.xxxAccess Control PolicyMM/DD/YYPURPOSE_______________________________________________________________To ensure that access controls are implemented and in compliance with IT security policies, standards, and procedures.  REFERENCE_______________________________________________________________National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications (SP): NIST SP 800-53a –Access Control (AC), NIST SP 800-12, NIST 800-46, NIST SP 800-48, NIST SP 800-77, NIST SP 800-94, NIST SP 800-97, NIST SP 800-100, NIST SP 800-113, NIST SP 800-114, NIST SP 800-121, NIST SP 800-124, NIST SP 800-164;NIST Federal Information Processing Standards(FIPS) 199POLICY_______________________________________________________________This policy is applicable to all departments and users of cisecurity resources and assets.1.ACCOUNT MANAGEMENTIT Department shall:a.Identify and select the following types of information system accounts to support organizational missions and business functions: individual, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.b.Assign account managers for information system accounts.c.Establish conditions for group and role membership.d.Specify authorized users of the information system, group and role membership, and access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account.e.Require approvalsby system owners for requests to create information system accounts.f.Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove information system accounts in accordance with approved procedures.g.Monitor the use of information system accounts.
h.Notify account managerswhen accounts are no longer required, when users are terminated or transferred, and when individual information system usage or need-to-know changes.i.Authorize access to the information system based on a valid access authorization or intended system usage.j.Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements At least once every six months.k.Establish a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group.l.Employ automated mechanisms to support the management of information system accounts.m.Ensure that the information system automatically disables temporary and emergency accounts after usage.n.Ensure that the information system automatically disables inactive accounts after90 dayso.Ensure that the information system automatically audits account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions, and notifies appropriate IT personnel.2.ACCESS ENFORCEMENTIT Department shall:a.Ensure that the information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.3.INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENTIT Department shall:a.Ensure that the information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems based on applicable policy.  4.SEPARATION OF DUTIESIT Departmentshall:a.Separate duties of individuals as necessary, to prevent malevolent activity without collusion.b.Document the separation of duties of individuals.
