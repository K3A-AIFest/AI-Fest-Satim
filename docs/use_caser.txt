in the main api server we need a new feautre called use case processor that shall also uses the existing experts and maybe extra ones to handle a use case and comparing it againts a set of standards and against a set of polices if the policies are provided 



the use case processors should have tools that implements and caluclated KPIS in the security feild domain (information security)


so ur job is to see online some KPIS and then implement them as tools.



the processor should also include deployment analysis of the use case , and higlghts the pros and cons of it  and suggest enhacemnts of the use case 


as the already exsiting mutli expert agents , i want an agent that takes care of depolyment analysis , another one to calculate the kpis , another one to judge the use case and another one that is called the aggregator that should aggrengate the analysis of each expert and returns a final analysis

ALL the models should use structued outputs , and please provide sustaimanle code ( not too long ugly files )


 

One thing to mention is that we are not going to store use cases in a vector db as their emebdding should be done online In case we want to embed them
