    IT Department shall:

       organizational missions and business functions: individual, shared, group, system, 
       guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.
    b. Assign account managers for information system accounts.
    c. Establish conditions for group and role membership.
    d. Specify authorized users of the information system, group and role membership, 
       and access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account.
    e. Require approvalsby system owners for requests to create information system accounts.
    f. Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove information system accounts in accordance with approved procedures.
    g. Monitor the use of information system accounts.

        Requirement 7: Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know
        
        7.1 Limit access to system components and cardholder data to only those individuals whose jobs require such access.
        
        7.1.1 Define and document access needs and privilege assignments for all user roles.
        
        7.1.2 Restrict access to privileged user IDs to least privileges necessary to perform job responsibilities.
        
        7.1.3 Assign access based on individual personnel's job classification and function.
        
        7.1.4 Implement an access control system(s) for systems components with multiple users to restrict access based on a user's need to know, and that is set to "deny all" unless specifically allowed.
        
        7.2 Implement system security features to ensure proper user authentication and access management for all system components.
        
        7.2.1 Cover all system components.
        
        7.2.2 Assign privileges to individuals based on job classification and function.
