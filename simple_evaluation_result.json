These types may include, but are not limited to, individual user accounts, shared accounts, guest accounts, emergency accounts, service accounts, and privileged accounts.\n\n2.  **Account Management Roles:** Account managers shall be assigned responsibility for managing information system accounts within their designated scope (e.g., system, application, or group of accounts).\n\n3.  **Access Authorization Basis:** Access to information systems and data shall be authorized based on a valid access authorization approved by the System Owner or designated authority, intended system usage, and the principle of least privilege/need-to-know. All users must authenticate using multi-factor authentication (MFA) before accessing sensitive systems.\n\n4.  **Authorized Users and Access Rights:** System owners, in coordination with account managers, are responsible for specifying authorized users of their systems, defining appropriate group and role memberships, and determining specific access authorizations (e.g., read, write, execute, administer) required by each user or role.\n\n5.  **Group and Role Membership:** Conditions and requirements for membership in information system groups and roles shall be established and documented.\n\n6.  **Account Lifecycle Management:** Information system accounts shall be managed throughout their lifecycle in accordance with approved procedures. This includes procedures for:\n    *   **Creation:** Accounts are created only upon approved requests (referencing section 3 & 4).\n    *   **Enabling:** Accounts are enabled only when needed and authorized.\n    *   **Modification:** Account permissions or attributes are modified based on changes in job role, need-to-know, or system usage, requiring re-authorization.\n    *   **Disabling:** Accounts are disabled when users are transferred, their need for access changes, or the account is no longer required.\n    *   **Removal:** Accounts are permanently removed after a defined period following disablement, unless organizational retention requirements dictate otherwise.\n\n7.  **Account Review:** Access rights and account attributes must be reviewed at least quarterly for compliance with account management requirements, necessity, and appropriateness.\n\n8.  **Account Revocation:** Access rights must be immediately revoked and accounts disabled or removed upon termination of employment or contractual relationship, or when access is no longer required.\n\n9.  **Account Monitoring:** The use of information system accounts shall be monitored to detect unauthorized activity and ensure compliance with policy and authorized use.\n\n10. **Notification of Changes:** Account managers shall be notified promptly when accounts are no longer required, when users are terminated or transferred, and when system usage or need-to-know changes, to facilitate timely account action.\n\n11. **Shared/Group Account Credential Management:** A process shall be established and followed for reissuing shared or group account credentials whenever an individual with access to those credentials is removed from the group or leaves the organization.",

        "rationale": "The original policy chunk was significantly lacking in detail when compared against NIST SP 800-53 AC-2 Account Management. While it covered periodic review (AC-2 j), termination revocation (partially AC-2 f/h), and system owner approval (AC-2 e), it missed numerous other critical components. The enhancements address these gaps directly by:\n\n*   Adding explicit requirements for identifying account types (AC-2 a).\n*   Mandating the assignment of account managers (AC-2 b).\n*   Requiring the establishment of conditions for group/role membership (AC-2 c).\n*   Detailing the need to specify authorized users, group/role memberships, and specific access authorizations (AC-2 d).\n*   Establishing comprehensive procedures for the entire account lifecycle (creation, enabling, modification, disabling, removal), not just termination (AC-2 f).\n*   Adding a requirement for monitoring account usage (AC-2 g).\n*   Including the necessary notification process for account managers regarding user status and need-to-know changes (AC-2 h).\n*   Clarifying that access authorization is based on multiple factors including valid authorization, intended usage, and need-to-know (AC-2 i).\n*   Adding a process for managing shared/group credentials upon individual removal (AC-2 k).\n\nThe enhanced content provides a much more complete framework for account management, aligning the policy closely with the detailed requirements of NIST SP 800-53 AC-2. Due to the large number of missing elements in the original policy, the classification remains 'MISSING', although the enhanced version is significantly improved and addresses the identified compliance gaps."
