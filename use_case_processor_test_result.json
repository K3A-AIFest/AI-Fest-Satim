It directly addresses critical risks such as unauthorized access, phishing, and credential stuffing, aligning strongly with key regulatory requirements like PCI-DSS. While the technical effectiveness and feasibility are rated highly (scores of 88.0 and 90.0 respectively), the analysis identified significant implementation challenges, particularly concerning integration with legacy systems and potential user adoption friction. A critical risk flag was raised by the failed KPI analysis, indicating potential issues with metrics or analysis processes that need urgent investigation. Key gaps include the explicit scope for customer accounts, service accounts, ensuring adherence to 'two distinct factors' policy, and integration with existing fraud detection and incident response frameworks. Overall, this initiative is critical for strengthening financial security but requires careful planning, robust resource allocation, and proactive risk mitigation, especially regarding integration complexity and ensuring comprehensive coverage.",
